How to connect ShipStation To Home Shopping Network

This was a fun project I worked on to help a client set up their automated packing slips and shipping labels sent over from the Home Shoping Network.

Review the files for the smart packing slip html/css files. Follow the mapping guide for HSN - DataTrans _ ShipStation logistics flow. 

Let me know if you have questions on this.
